### WebSocket Integration using Socket.IO
The server has been enhanced to support real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients using WebSocket technology via Socket.IO. This enables seamless, instant data exchange between the server and connected clients, fostering interactive and dynamic web applications.

**Summary:** 
The recent updates to the backend server bring about improved routing, dynamic content rendering with Handlebars, and real-time communication capabilities through WebSocket integration using Socket.IO.
