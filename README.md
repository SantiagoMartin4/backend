### WHAT'S NEW ON MY BACKEND PROJECT?


### Login and Authentication Logic
- Implemented login and authentication logic with file storage persistence in a MongoDB database using Express-Sessions.

### Updated Handlebars Views
- Updated Handlebars views for register, login, and products wich are only available for view when an user is logged in.

### User Roles Logic
- Implemented logic for assigning admin or user roles based on email and password. Admin credentials are hardcoded and validated in JavaScript, then added to the MongoDB database using a schema.

**Summary:** 
The recent updates also include login and authentication logic with MongoDB file storage, updated Handlebars views for secure access, and user role assignment logic for admin privileges.
